# Welcome to AquaMate's inner workings!

**Application URL: <https://aquamate.me>**

## Welcome fellow fish and code enthusiest!

Here you will find the files that make up the website "AquaMate." Please feel free to suggest changes/additions/deletions :)
I would ask that my files NOT be forked or copied in order to uphold the spirit of this websites main goal, but I will leave the repository open as a show of my value of free information exchange










This project was forked from the original source repository which belongs to my Alma Mater's (San Francisco State University) CS department, and Professor Song.
Thank you, Professor Song, for giving us the opportunity to dream.
